/*
    Given an array A of size n of integers in the range from 1 to n, we need to find the inverse permutation of that array.
    Inverse Permutation is a permutation which you will get by inserting position of an element at the position specified by
    the element value in the array. For better understanding, consider the following example:
    Suppose we found element 4 at position 3 in an array, then in reverse permutation, we insert 3 (position of element 4 in the array)
     in position 4 (element value).

    Example 1:

    Input:
    N = 4
    Arr[] = {1, 4, 3, 2}
    Output:
    1 4 3 2
    Explanation:
    For element 1 we insert position of 1 from
    arr1 i.e 1 at position 1 in arr2. For element
    4 in arr1, we insert 2 from arr1 at position
    4 in arr2. Similarly, for element 2 in arr1,
    we insert position of 2 i.e 4 in arr2.

    Example 2:

    Input:
    N = 5
    Arr[] = {2, 3, 4, 5, 1}
    Output:
    5 1 2 3 4
    Explanation:
    As index 1 has value 2 so 1 will b
    placed at index 2, similarly 2 has
    3 so 2 will be placed at index 3
    similarly 3 has 4 so placed at 4,
    4 has 5 so 4 placed at 5 and 5
    has 1 so placed at index 1.

    Your Task:
    You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function inversePermutation() which takes
    the array Arr[] and its size N as inputs and returns the vector array after performing inverse permutation on Arr.

    Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
    Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N)

    Constraints:
    1 ≤ N ≤ 105
    1 ≤ A[i] ≤ N
    Note: Array should contain unique elements and should
      have all elements from 1 to N.
